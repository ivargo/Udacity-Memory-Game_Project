## Instructions

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.

The player flips over two hidden cards at a time. Where the cards match, they stay open. If the cards do not match, they are flipped back to their original position, face down.

Then the player makes the next move. The aim of the game is to have all pairs matched with as little moves as possible.

The game ends when all cards on the board are matched, displaying the score and prompting for a replay.

At anytime during the game, the player can reshuffle the cards, zeroing the score and the timer.

## Score and timer

The game counts the moves of the player. Each flipping over of two cards is considered 1 move. A 3-star rating is attached to any achievement below 12 moves, inclusive.

Thereafter, the star rating is reduced by a half-star for each next 3 moves.  The score becomes 'zero stars' for 27 and above moves.

When the score is zeroed, the rating becomes full three stars again.

A timer counts the seconds from the click for opening of the first card until the game-end.
